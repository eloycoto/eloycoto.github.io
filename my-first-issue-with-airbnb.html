                <p>In early 2012 I met Airbnb. At the first time (I was living in Spain yet) I
thought that was not a very good idea. I was mainly scared about the fact that
I would be sharing a house with complete strangers.</p>
<p>When I arrived in London a lot of people of Google Campus were using it. So in
early 2013 I gave it a try.</p>
<p>From early 2013, I made dozens of travels using Airbnb. Both professionally and
leisure. Nowadays I think that I couldn't live without this service.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="class" src="img/airbnb_logo.png" />
</div>
<p>From mid 2013 I've travelled to London around one time per month. If I need to
book a hotel I would spend a lot of days with crappy internet connection and
nobody to speak with after work. Using Airbnb gave me a chance to speak with a
lot of English people, learning UK culture, etc... Actually, some of my
previous hosts are now my friends.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-first-airbnb-trouble">
<h2>The first Airbnb trouble</h2>
<p>So, in January 2015, I had a reservation in a London house. I arrived on Sunday
afternoon and all was ok, so no problem. Monday got home after work and it was
freezing. I waited for the host. At 21:00 I sent her an sms and an email, at
22:00 I called her but she hanged up my call.</p>
<p>So at 22:30 I opened an issue in Airbnb, telling that the home was freezing and
the host didn't reply to my intents of communication. Few hours later, I was in
bed with 2 duvets and 2 blankets, and Annie from Airbnb called me. She was very
very kind with me and she also offered me the chance to move to any hotel, or
try different options. By that time the host already arrived and she powered on
the central heating, so it was not needed to moved at that time in the night.
Problem fixed! - I thought.</p>
<p>At 3:30 my room was freezing again. I tried to sleep but at 6:00 AM I woke up
and I went to work. At 8:00 I wrote a email to the host if she could provide a
solution for the heating.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="class" src="img/airbnb.png" />
</div>
<p>During the morning I <strong>tried</strong> to speak with Airbnb, but nobody replied my
emails.  So I didn't know where I'll sleep Tuesday night. Meanwhile the host
didn't reply me.</p>
<p>At 17:00 UK time, I wrote a public tweet, and in 20 minutes someone from Airbnb
support rang me. They want to catch up with my issue! USA customer services
started to work again. :-)</p>
<p>At 18:00 Annie called me again. She was the best support agent that I ever had.
She gave me some options (another house, hotels). I selected another house that
I used before. After few hours and dozens of Annie calls, I was in a warm house!
I'm quite happy with Annie's support, she gave me a lot of options. Meanwhile
two different Europe agents closed my tickets without any comment. I'm pissed
off with that.</p>
<p>I was quite worried during Tuesday morning, I didn't want to move around London
in the evening. Europe support didn't provide me any solution.</p>
<p>So, I totally recommend Airbnb! I never had problems before. USA agents and
Annie helped me a lot, but it definitely looks that they need some work in the
Europe customer service if they want to keep the good work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, and more related with my field, Airbnb needs to improve the
calls quality. I had some issues with it and even some of the calls got dropped.</p>
