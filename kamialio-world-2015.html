  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Last week of May I had the luck to attend <a class="reference external" href="http://conference.kamailio.com/k03/">Kamailio World Conference</a>. It was my third time and as usually I
learnt a lot. <strong>Kamailio was born fourteen years ago</strong>, so a lot of people had a
lot of things to show.</p>
<p>This year the conference was focused in the following topics:</p>
<div class="section" id="webrtc">
<h2>WebRTC</h2>
<p><em>WebRTC</em> is the highway to the future. HTML5 is a reality in web world nowadays.
WebRTC is supported in some browsers and only need a push from Apple and
Microsoft to reach all possible customers. Meanwhile companies like <a class="reference external" href="http://corporate.tuenti.com/en/dev/blog/Building-a-VoIP-Service-using-WebRTC">Tuenti</a>
are using WebRTC in their apps and they provide some valuable feedback to the
community.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yPtUbZcaKs">Tim Panton</a> explained how to
make WebRTC interact with some other HTML features. I loved the concept and I
think that WebRTC doesn't need to be another phone in the web. Innovation and
integration with the web will be the key to the success.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEjYj0AUlM">Jssip</a> was explained by José
Luis Millán. I use to work with this library, so for me was not as interested
as it could be. But if you want to add some SIP-over-websocket library you
should definitely take a look to this talk.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mobile-operators-ims">
<h2>Mobile Operators- IMS</h2>
<p>I'm not an expert in IMS or mobile operators, but some of the talks gave us
some insights about the IMS world. As every year I learnt a lot about IMS. This
time <a class="reference external" href="http://kamailio.org/docs/modules/devel/modules/smsops.html">3GPP-SMS-V2 kamailio module</a> was presented
by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgYVMHVUemM">Carsten Bock</a>, and he
introduced us in the SMS solutions using Kamailio.</p>
<p>About mobile operators <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4iu7dIdczI">Dragos Vingarzan</a> shows to us all the possible
solutions about open mobile networks. He explained about how to build
distributed mobile network and dived us into <a class="reference external" href="http://www.openepc.com/">OpenEPC project</a>. In case of natural disasters this project is a
fast solution for rescue teams. Well done!</p>
<p>Every year FhG Fokus Institute exposes all the new stuff related with mobile
network. This year <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ5hjvZnmUk">Thomas Magedanz</a> explained all the work that
they are doing in 5G technology.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="pure-voip-applications">
<h2>Pure Voip Applications</h2>
<p>The reason why I always go to KWorld is for Voice Apps and to learn about third
party applications that integrates with Kamailio. Last year I had seen Cgrates
and few months later I started to use it.</p>
<p>This year <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsvcwleb-fY">Dan presented Cgrates LCR</a>, this technology is pretty
interesting for wholesale providers. In the other hand Matt Jordan provided us
some insights about how to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CnrU5A2g1Q">build voice apps with the new version of Asterisk</a>. I really love the new ARI
interface and it's matches perfectly with my idea of immutable servers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XIrR9bwUkM&amp;index=23&amp;list=PLDaEs5k2Xy-vZ_zyz989AWkz8txu7YQYY">Federico Cabiddu</a>
talked about the <a class="reference external" href="http://kamailio.org/docs/modules/devel/modules/tsilo.html">TSILO</a> module, it's
gorgeous.  I think that TSILO module is too useful when your business logic is
not into your kamailio config file. I'm looking forward to use TSILO with <a class="reference external" href="http://kamailio.org/docs/modules/devel/modules/evapi.html">Evapi
module</a> and it'll
help me a lot.</p>
<p>Another hot topic was application monitoring. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5IllQMSyKY&amp;index=8&amp;list=PLDaEs5k2Xy-vZ_zyz989AWkz8txu7YQYY">Alexandr Dubovikov</a>
presented the new version of <a class="reference external" href="http://sipcapture.org/">SIPcapture</a>. Now you
don't have any reason to don't start using it.  On the other hand, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0udEXKF9nAk&amp;index=25&amp;list=PLDaEs5k2Xy-vZ_zyz989AWkz8txu7YQYY">Tudor
Golubenco</a>
presented <a class="reference external" href="https://www.elastic.co/products/beats">PacketBeat</a> a software to
monitor the performance of your application.</p>
<p>Sipgate always shows amazing use cases, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB8F2bxtsGU">last year they spoke</a> about their infrastructure.
This year <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8e0D2aOE5A&amp;list=PLDaEs5k2Xy-vZ_zyz989AWkz8txu7YQYY&amp;index=9">Sebastian Damm gave a amazing talk</a>
about how they are providing services over IPv6. Hands-on with <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nnjfzVAWaqt9taCOsJcdEnlrJyxbAKVZRsUdunZGfF8/viewform">lunch.sipgate.de</a>
too, really nice initiative.</p>
<p>Kazoo <strong>is</strong> the innovation player in Kamailio. Glad to have them onboard. They
have all the config files in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/2600hz/kazoo-configs">Github</a> and you can learn a lot from them,
it's a great example! This year <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukioKekTHIg">Luis Azedo</a> was speaking about kazoo
module that is a message queue for Kamailio. Kazoo + TSILO + EVAPI can provide
a new way to make things in Kamailio and I'm looking forward to use/write about
it.</p>
<p>Another talk was given by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyZq8jZaJ7U">Simon Tennant</a> about protocols and why some
protocols were not successful. Simon is the CEO at Buddycloud. I met BuddyCloud
early 2012 in Fosdem conference. Buddycloud is a chat/twitter service based on
XMPP and open standards. You should keep an eye on this project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="security">
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>As often, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSZvMfDnLts">Olle E. Johansson</a>
gave one of the keynotes. He explained all the problems related with old
technology and provide advices to be more secure, revolutionary and keep the
open standards, you know <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/morecrypto?src=hash">#morecrypto</a></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jesusprubio/bluebox-ng">Bluebox-ng</a> was presented by my
friend <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/s3rgiogr">Sergio</a> one of the core developers. He
explained all the possible attacks in SIP and he provided some examples + tricks
about how Bluebox can help you to keep your platform secure. He spoke about
custom scripts in Bluebox so I'll check to integrate this in our Jenkis
workflow.</p>
<p>The last talk was given by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWRQamkCtTs">Daniel</a>. He spoke about some security
tips in our kamailio config files. I need to say that I don't agree 100 percent
with his point of view. I think that redis is more effective than any sql in
memory database as backend, but same approach can be used with redis in this
case.</p>
The last talk was given by <a

misunderstanding a little bit. Daniel mentioned another databases and lua
scripts, and all mysql was only a examples.  Nowadays in my cases I'm using
redis as cache system, so I think that for us it's more useful & simple. My
advice you must use the backend that fit in your installation in my case
Redis works perfect.<p>Finally I missed a lot of people: Carlos Ruiz from TokyApp, Torrey from Voxbone,
Anton from Quobis... active members that I always learn a lot from them. In the
other hand big thanks to all the people that were involved in this conference.
It was a blast!</p>
