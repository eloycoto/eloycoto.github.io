    <p>As every year, the first week of February, Fosdem took place. The conference was
online for the first time, and I think that we all missed the rain and the snow.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the conference; it was not the same; also, it was hard to get
time over the weekend to see the talks. Online conferences should rethink a bit
the schedules, but overall I'm more than happy with the result!</p>
<p>As usual, I went to multiple talks. This year, the talk that I most enjoyed was
the one given by <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/1nuritzi">Nuritzi Sanchez</a>, she showed a
different way to think about communication and how to build trust with other
cultures, from now on, I'm going to share with many people <a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/community_devroom_communication_hacks/attachments/slides/4675/export/events/attachments/community_devroom_communication_hacks/slides/4675/FOSDEM_2021_Communication_Hacks.pdf">[slides]</a>.</p>

be crucial in the next couple of years, and I think this will change how Edge
Computing will behave.</p>
<p>Regarding containers, I highly recommend the talk by my former colleague <a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/containers_ebpf_kernel/">Daniel
Borkmann</a>,
impressive work made by Cilium team. <a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/speaker/viktor_farcic/">Viktor Farcic</a> made an excellent
presentation about Argo CD, also recommend his Youtube channel. Another famous
Youtuber, <a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/speaker/david_mckay/">David McKay</a>, made two talks, I
enjoyed Cluster API one, and the Telegraph one is worth to listen.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/speaker/peter_zaitsev/">Peter Zaitsev</a> made
many talks, this one about performance testing has very good tips, I'll keep in
my bookmarks for the future, a lot of good things there.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/speaker/brad_fitzpatrick/">Brad Fitzpatrick</a>
background is unachievable, and he shared how Tailscale is using Golang. I loved
Tailscale, and maybe I'm biased, but I found very interesting the problems
regarding Golang net.IP types.</p>
<p>Finally, this was my Fosdem, and I'm so thankful to all organisers to keep the
level so high! Thanks for always giving a weekend of joy!</p>
