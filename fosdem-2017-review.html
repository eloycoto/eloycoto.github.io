                <p>My third <a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2017/">FOSDEM</a> is over, this year there was a
<a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/real_time_communications/">Real Time Comms dev room</a> in place,
one of the best places to keep up to date with all VoIP technologies.
Furthermore, in this conference, you can just jump into another track and learn
from them, this helps you to be out of your comfort zone. I am so glad to be
there and have the chance to have a chat with all open-source community.</p>
<p>First I want to start thanking the RTC track organisers, <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/saghul">Saúl Ibarra</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/miconda">Daniel-Constantin Mierla</a>, organise this type of events is a tremendous
amount of work.</p>
<p>The day started with an excellent WebRTC introduction, I got in touch with
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/webrtc/adapter">Adapter.js</a> library, Steven advised us to
limit the endpoints if we can, and he shared that sometimes you should guess
where is the media problem instead find it. The second talk, by <a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/speaker/martin_lagrange/">Martin</a>, was about
real-time protocols and he made a splendid introduction about few tools.
<a class="reference external" href="https://telepathy.freedesktop.org/">Telepathy</a> talk was quite sweet, it is
nice to know that all this software still works and new ideas are on the
roadmap. IoT XMPP by <a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/speaker/daniel_wisnewski/">Daniel</a> was great; I
have some doubts about XMPP on the IoT world related to power consumption and
bandwidth, but the idea behind <a class="reference external" href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0323.html">XEP-0323</a> is excellent.</p>
<p>The best VoIP talk, from my point of view, was from <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mattcjordan">Matt Jordan</a> about Asterisk scalability. The concept is
the same that Matt argued few times in the past conferences. It was awesome to
see new <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Asterisk+14+Recordings+REST+API#Asterisk14RecordingsRESTAPI-getStoredFile">ARI methods for recordings</a>,
the <a class="reference external" href="https://blogs.asterisk.org/2016/09/21/asterisk-14-publishing-extension-state/">publish-subscribe interface</a>
(I did not have an idea about that and it fixes many problems). Following Matt,
the Basque VoIP mafia took action, Saúl made an introduction to <a class="reference external" href="https://meet.jit.si">Jitsi WebRTC
solutions</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jmillan">Jose Luis Millán</a> about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jssip.net/">JsSIP</a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ibc/mediasoup">Mediasoup</a> was explained by <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/ibc_tw">Iñaki Baz</a>. I recommend you to view those talks online if
you weren't there.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/ring_opendht/">Ring's presentation</a>
was great to be out of my comfort zone and to see how other projects solve
their problems. Next talk was by the energetic Olle; he showed a very clear
state of the art why <a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/dualstack/">IPv6 implementation is failing</a>. It was good to hear from
first-hand info about new <a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/opensips/">OpenSips</a>; new release looks
promising based on Event Routes, plus the CGRates module or RabbitMQ
integration. On the other hand, <a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/speaker/giovanni_maruzzelli_gmaruzz/">Giovanni</a> from
OpenTelecoms made an excellent explanation about Freeswich scalability methods
and explained very well the distribution and partition methods. After lunch,
<a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/speaker/lorenzo_mangani/">Lorenzo</a> gave a
talk about Hormer; I got a lot of new ideas, and things like <a class="reference external" href="https://siren.solutions/kibi-a-kibana-fork-for-data-intelligence/">Kibi</a> were mind
blowing for me. I thoroughly recommend to follow <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lmangani">Lorenzo on Twitter and GitHub</a>; he is full of common-sense with innovative
ideas. The last VoIP talk that I attend was given by Daniel about <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kamailio.org/w/2016/05/sip-routing-in-lua-or-python/">Kemi</a>, I need to
say that he introduced something awesome in the next Kamailio version, this
interface is going to be essential in the near future.</p>
<img alt="Miconda about kemi" class="align-center" src="img/fosdem-1.jpg" />
<p>After my RTC update, my idea for Fosdem was to taste Belgium beers and extend
my knowledge of my second skills like DevOps, Python and Postgresql.</p>
<p>I started with <a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/grpc101/">GRPC</a>; it is
a high-performance RPC framework. I use to work with that on CGRates. It was
good to know that Google is using GPRC over HTTP2, so it is much faster and
bi-directional streaming can be used.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://joshix.com/">CoreOS DocOps</a> introduced <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator">Kubernetes
Operators</a>. From my point of
view, all containers/microservers miss the point about the state, with
Kubernetes operators this state can be dry or handled. This feature is
game-changing in the world of the containers, plus some examples shown during
the talk helped the audience to get it. This technology fixes something that I
usually work around using Hashicorp tools, in the following months I am going
to check k8s operators and deploy.</p>
<p>Finally, I tried to be in a Testing dev room, but it had a massive queue, so I
moved into the Postgresql track. <a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/speaker/jimmy_angelakos/">Jimmy</a> introduced RDF
(Resource Description Framework). He provided some examples, and I think that I
would use that in the future. Need to say that I learn something awesome
Sqlalchemy stream_results.  After that, <a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/speaker/gulcin_yildirim/">Gülçin</a> from 2ndquadrant
explained all the replication process for fault tolerance; she explained in
cleartext the different wal level settings, something that I did not understand
at all, but she made an awesome explanation, you should check the video. The
last Postgres talk by <a class="reference external" href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/speaker/gunnar_bluth_nick/">Gunnar Bluth</a>, introduced to
me, two new concepts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>RTO(recovery time objective)</em>: How long took to recover from an incident</li>
<li><em>RPO(Recovery point objective)</em>: How many lost are you going to have from an incident.</li>
</ul>
<p>I knew all the technical details of this talk, but need to say that this
presentation changed how I am going to think about redundancy in the future, I
always looking for issues, but never think about RTO or RPO and never how to
measure it.</p>
<p>Fosdem is over. This year I shared this travel with some friends from Vigo,
which made myself happy during all the trip. I learnt a lot from them too; <strong>I
am so glad</strong> to share these days with a few python and ruby hackers, a <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/diepg">Webkit
committer</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/felixgomezlopez">Main dev</a> of one of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.meneame.net/">largest Spain websites</a>. Thanks to you all! Besides it was good to see in
person some people from the VoIP community, and meet some people that I didn't
meet <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/hellc2/status/827878864743518208">before</a>.</p>
<img alt="Vigo dev community on fosdem 2017" class="align-center" src="img/fosdem-2.jpg" />
<p>Finally, some people have problems with the Fosdem Agenda. I need to say that I
did not have these problems, but a few weeks ago before Fosdem, I made my plan.
Sometimes in this conference is better to see fewer talks but be at the door 10
min before, and not leave some talks in the middle (that it is very
unrespectful) or see the agenda in the laptops and check the content of the
next speaker. This type of conference should be prepared in advance, if not you
are going to be frustrated in the queues.</p>
<p>Thanks to all, and see you next year!</p>
