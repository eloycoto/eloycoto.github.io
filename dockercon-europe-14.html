    <p>I was in the <a class="reference external" href="http://europe.dockercon.com/">dockercon Europe</a> only for one
reason: I think that docker and the VoIP world will be good friends. However,
some problems will need to be sorted before that can happen. At the moment the
state of the VoIP Docker support is far better than optimal, but I am pretty
sure that it will be there in just few months, or even weeks because <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/docker/docker/graphs/commit-activity">Docker is
growing so fast.</a></p>
<p>I need to admit that my expectations before the conference were big, but the
result was even better than what I was expected. It was <strong>awesome</strong>! The
organization was <strong>perfect</strong>, venue, sound, displays, lights, WiFi, food,
<strong>everything</strong>.</p>
<p>About the conference, it lasts for 2 days, split in 2 different kind of talks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Keynotes from amazing people as the Docker CTO, CEO, ING IT manager, Netflix
architect... focussed in use cases and solutions.</li>
<li>And some deeper talks about solutions, how to's, and a lot of tips.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="docker-community">
<h2>Docker Community</h2>
<p>One of the best things that Docker is doing is take care of their community.
It's growing a lot, loads of pull request &amp; lots of new ideas. Manage this is
not easy and keeping track of all of those while you continue maintaining a
happy community is a hard work.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.slideshare.net/shykes/open-design-at-large-scale">The solution</a>
for them is to split the project in small projects, and keep a different set of
maintainers for <a class="reference external" href="https://clusterhq.com/blog/docker-extensions/">each plugin</a>
of the real engine. This idea is amazing, and makes it easier for new parties
doing integrations-solutions. I love it &lt;3</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="docker-machine">
<h2>Docker Machine</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/docker/machine">Docker Machine</a> was the first new
announcement. The tool is quite powerful for admins or devs. Sadly, after deep
a little bit in the code is not as powerful as <em>I thought when they announced
it in the conference</em>. It's definitely a tool to keep watching, but, at the
moment <a class="reference external" href="http://agonzalezro.github.io/how-i-prepared-my-mac-to-make-some-docker-development.html">I'll keep my host machines with docker and shared volumes with my host.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="docker-swarm">
<h2>Docker Swarm</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/docker/swarm/">This announcement made me happy</a>.
Orchestration is difficult, very difficult, <a class="reference external" href="https://speakerdeck.com/vieux/docker-swarm">Swarm is the first step of
something that I hope will be great</a>. Use docker as normal with
Swarm is quite useful, and easy to make it grow. Things like volumes or
networking linking will continue to be difficult, but I'm sure that will be
fixed in less than 4 months ;-).</p>
<p>On the other hand: <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/capotribu/status/540851114242211840/photo/1">Mesos looks like that will integrate with Docker Swarm</a>, this
relation makes Swam even more powerful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="docker-compose">
<h2>Docker Compose</h2>
<p>When docker announced the acquisition of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.fig.sh/">fig</a>, I was
thinking that the service would be merged into docker, but it looks that I was
wrong. Docker Compose use the same fig structure and I love it. Compose will
help a lot to devs, and I'm sure that in relation with Swarm they will do a
very good mix.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="another-talks">
<h2>Another talks</h2>
<p>About the other talks: some of them were amazing: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mitchellh">Mitchell Hashimoto</a> presented <a class="reference external" href="http://terrafon.io">terrafon.io</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://consul.io">consul.io</a>. Both projects are
awesome. Consul.io will help to move from vertical scaling to horizontal
scaling in a lot of VoIP projects. Hopefully in few weeks I will write about
kamailio and consul ;-)</p>
<img alt="Dockercon Europe start" class="align-center" src="img/dockercon-hard.jpg" />
<p>Another talks were about tips, tips to build more faster, tips about how to
migrate old platforms, about how to move Docker to production, how to use it in
CI environments, those talks wer kinda useful.</p>
<p>In the other hand, there were some other talks that I didn't like: BBC CI, Rafe
Colton talk... but it's quite difficult to keep the high level during all the
talks of the conference.</p>
<p>Another think that it has impacted me is that the USA devs are far better
storytellers than Europe devs (We need to learn :-))</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sponsors">
<h2>Sponsors</h2>
<p>Usually I don't like the sponsors trying to sell me something, but thanks to
the sponsorships at Dockerconf I got to met <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tutum.co/">Tutum</a>
(Amazing project to deploy multiple containers), a bit about <a class="reference external" href="https://clusterhq.com/">ClusterHQ</a> and I also saw that some vendors (as IBM, HP,
Vmware, Azure) getting involved in this technology which makes me happy. Thanks
to them for support the conference.</p>
<p>On Thursday night I had a chat with Solomon Hykes about networking. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/8951">He shared
with me this open issues</a>, I
realised that openvswitch is really powerful, and some other small tips about
networking. I'll test them and I'll tell you the results of my tests. It's
amazing how this disruptive web technology can be part of the VoIP Solutions,
I'm also sure that 2015 will be, for me, the year that I'll build a lot of VoIP
servers into containers ;-)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally my conclusion about docker after the conference is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All the people use docker in testing environments.</li>
<li>Docker is the future, but it's still hard in production.</li>
<li>Docker is not just the technology, the good thing is the community.</li>
<li>Split the project in small pieces, will keep the pieces small, and will be
easy to maintain, grown and focus. <em>Congrats to all, I love this idea &lt;3</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing more to add to the Dockercon summary. Thanks to all the Docker
community for this amazing conference, all the people made it amazing. Thanks
to the organizers. All conference was incredible, the venue, the party, ALL. I
know that organize events like this it's a lot of effort. Big thanks.</p>
<p>Hopefully see you in the next Dockercon Europe!</p>
