Last Jun we had an excellent conference in Vigo Galicia. More than 180 python
devs meet in the PyDay Galicia 2017. The conference was awesome; I learnt a lot
of things related to Machine Learning, and I can catch up with some old friends
like Ismael Hasan, who is now working in Elastic.

I gave a lighting talk related to logging. I want to explain the rules that I
use to follow to write logs. Here you have the slides.
