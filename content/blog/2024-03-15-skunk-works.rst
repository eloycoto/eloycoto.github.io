Recently, a good friend convinced me to dive into a book I initially approached
with scepticism. However, after delving into its pages, I can confidently say
it has secured its place among my top favourites. "Skunk Works" is the
pseudonym behind Lockheed Martin's Advanced Development Programs (ADP), written
by Ben Rich, offering profound insights into their operational dynamics and
monumental achievements.

The book was truly remarkable in numerous aspects. It shed light on their
groundbreaking technologies, how they operate and handle classified information
within their workforce, their effective strategies for navigating political
obstacles, their innovative approaches, how the CIA operated, and how they
reused technology from previous projects.

One thing that I can highlight: the engineers were forced to be in the shop,
touching what they designed so that they could understand it. The workforce in
the workshop followed the Japanese way, and they owned the quality assurance.

It was fascinating how they iterated over prototypes, and how they built the
SR-71; they were a "Lean startup" in the fifties!

Personally, I found immense value not only in the technical intricacies laid
out but also in the invaluable soft skills lessons. The final chapter should be
mandatory in the school curriculum; it's a masterpiece to achieve simplicity!

Here are my favourite quotes:

   “Ben, why don’t we make the stealth fighter automated from takeoff to
   attack and return? We can plan the entire mission on computers, transfer it
   onto a cassette that the pilot loads into his onboard computers, that will
   route him to the target and back and leave all the driving to us.” To my
   amazement they actually developed this automated program in only 120 days
   and at a cost of only $2.5 million. It was so advanced over any other
   program that the Air Force bought it for use in all their attack airplanes."

    “I enjoyed the goodwill of my colleagues because most of us had worked
    together intimately under tremendous pressures for more than a quarter
    century. Working isolated, under rules of tight security, instilled a
    camaraderie probably unique in the American workplace.”

   "To buck smothering bureaucratic controls inside or outside government takes
   unusual pluck and courage. Smallness, modest budgets, and limiting
   objectives to modest numbers of prototypes are not very rewarding goals in
   an era of huge multinational conglomerates with billion-dollar cash flows.
   There are very few strong-willed individualists in the top echelons of big
   business—executives willing or able to decree the start of a new product
   line by sheer force of personal conviction, or willing to risk investment in
   unproven technologies. As salaries climb into the realm of eight-figure
   annual paychecks for CEOs, and company presidents enjoy stock options worth
   tens of millions, there is simply too much at stake for any executive turtle
   to stick his neck out of the shell. Very, very few in aerospace or any other
   industry are concerned about the future beyond the next quarterly
   stockholders’ report."
