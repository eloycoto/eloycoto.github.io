I had the privilege of attending PyConEs, the largest tech conference in my
town. From the moment it was announced, I knew it would be an incredible event,
especially since many of the organizers were close friends whom I admire.

Although I'm not heavily involved in Python development (though I've been using
it more recently due to the AI trend), I thoroughly enjoyed the conference.
Here are my favorite talks and key learnings:

1. Introduction to Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
-----------------------------------------------------------

This talk was outstanding. I learned about adjusting AI models with expected
formulas and how AI might help discover new physics equations. I'm excited to
delve deeper into this topic soon.

2. MLOps: Maintaining a Healthy ML Infrastructure
-------------------------------------------------

Daniel Cabo's presentation on MLOps was exceptional. He taught us how to
maintain a robust ML infrastructure for both inference and training data.

3. Quantum Computing
----------------------

We were fortunate to have Ismael Faro on stage, sharing his vision of quantum
computing. It was fascinating to see how AI and quantum worlds may interact. I
believe this convergence will happen sooner than we think. I was particularly
shocked by IBM's use of AI to transpile quantum circuits.

4. Oxidizing Python Projects
----------------------------

Diego's talk on integrating Rust into Python projects was illuminating. I was
impressed by how Qiskit uses pyO3 and Rust to improve performance. The
integration of Rayon with Python was a pleasant surprise.

5. The Python GIL: Informative and Entertaining
-----------------------------------------------

Pablo Galindo's presentation on the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) was
both informative and funny.

6. AI in Fashion: Outfit Generator
----------------------------------

Clara Marti's talk on Inditex's outfit generator help me to understand better
the convolution neural network

Volunteering and Networking
---------------------------

I had the opportunity to lead an open space session, which turned out to be a
great experience thanks to the enthusiastic participants.

One of the highlights was reconnecting with many old friends I hadn't seen
during my recovery period. It was wonderful to learn from them again.

As a volunteer, I had the chance to speak with the Galician Education Counselor
about remote work opportunities in Galicia. I also took on the role of advising
the organizers on potential issues and suggesting proactive solutions, and I
love that role!

A Personal Note
---------------

Just days before the conference, I received news of three new small tumors.
Initially, I considered not attending, but knowing how hard Alex and the Python
Vigo team had worked, I decided to go and support them. I couldn't be happier
with that decision.

A big thank you to Alex for leading and to the Python Vigo team for organizing
this fantastic event!

PS: As a special treat, volunteers received awesome swag crafted by A
Industriosa members using a laser cutter.
