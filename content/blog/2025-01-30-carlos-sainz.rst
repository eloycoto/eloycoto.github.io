.. epigraph::

    Squash is a sport with a bad reputation, but it's a fantastic sport. It's a
    sport where aerobic capacity is incredible—there's no other like it. The
    reflexes, 360-degree peripheral vision, and excellent coordination make it
    unique. I personally believe that for motorsports, it helped me a lot.
    That's why I always recommend squash as one of the best sports a driver
    could practice.

.. epigraph::

    Absolutely, for a parent, there is no greater satisfaction than seeing a
    son or daughter do things well, succeed, and gain recognition. Yes, I am
    proud of what they do, what they have done—seeing them win, seeing them
    enjoy it, and also seeing how they do it. Watching them fight, seeing them
    go through appendicitis and then win a race two weeks later, seeing the
    excitement with which they prepared and how they did it—that is something
    to be proud of.

    -- Carlos Sainz

.. epigraph::

   My father was a very humble man. He came from a very, very humble family.
   He lost his father at the age of 12 and had to leave school to start
   working, even falsifying his birthdate to be able to work. He has an
   incredible story—a truly remarkable story that serves as an example in many
   ways. And for me, he certainly was. He was a great fighter in a difficult
   time… He wasn’t necessarily tough or affectionate; he was a man who had
   lived through hard times. When he got angry, he could be tough, but he was
   also the most generous person I have ever known.

    -- Carlos Sainz
