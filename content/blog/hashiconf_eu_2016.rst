Few days ago I was in Amsterdam, in the lovely `Hashiconf EU
<https://www.hashiconf.eu/>`__. This conference fulfilled all my expectations
about hashi tools and the devops world. The conference was organized by `Xebia
<https://xebia.com/>`__ with the help of `Hashicorp
<https://www.hashicorp.com/>`__ and it was awesome, everything was great: venue,
sound, food, talks and the party!

Let me explain why I went to this conference; the main reason is that nowadays
I'm doing a lot of devops, the vision of Hashicorp is very similar to my
ideas/problems so I'm learning a lot from them. In the other hand a lot of talks
were case studies from companies, so I learnt from other people's problems.

The conference started with `Mitchell Hashimoto's
<https://twitter.com/mitchellh>`__ keynote, and  I want to emphasize the
following points:

- The initial support to import in Terraform.
- Maps and list in Terraform.
- Terraform state cli.
- Vault code audit and the new features added in 0.6.

Related with Nomad, they did a good improvement release, `nomad plan` is a boost
to the project and being able to run 1M containers in less than 300 seconds is a
good selling point. Also, he announced that `Vektra joins Hashicorp
<https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vektra-joins-hashicorp.html>`__ and they are
going to release  a new log management tool called `Current
<https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/742624496763428864>`__.

The second keynote was from `Nicki Watt <https://twitter.com/techiewatt>`__ from
the London based `OpenCredo <https://opencredo.com/>`__. I loved this `talk
<https://speakerdeck.com/nickithewatt/hashiconf-eu-2016-building-secure-environments-in-clouds-using-hashicorp-tools>`__!
Real problem was described from start and solutions were explained with the
proper balance between code and theory. The integration and workflow between
Terraform, Vault, Cloudinit gave me good insights for our infrastructure. In the
other hand I got the following quote, that is great:

.. epigraph::

    The only thing constant in life is change
    --  Fran√ßois de la Rochefoucauld


One of the topics that I was more interested was `Nomad
<https://www.nomadproject.io/>`__. A good review was given by `Diptanu
<https://twitter.com/diptanu>`__, he has a lot of experience in schedulers. In
my opinion all schedulers will be a good trend to follow, and all related with
the microservices. Some keypoints about it:

- It's simpler than other solutions.
- It's not as complete as kubernetes, but fill the gap for a lot of companies.
- I can't fully get how nomad can export public interfaces or network constraints.
- Traffic shaping it's good but not sure how nomad will work with media traffic.
- Restart on jitter is great.
- **Nomad fs** is good, but need to change the paradigm in support teams.
- All this orchestrators lose the way about dependency requirements between microservices.

`Vault <https://www.vaultproject.io/>`__ was another hot topic in the
conference. This secret manager is great and the following uses are marvelous
for all the companies:

- SSH credentials
- ACL policies
- DB credentials

A lot of people use Vault on production environments, so I'll give a try soon.
If you want to see an example, this is a good repository to start.

Day two started with `Anne Currie <https://twitter.com/anne_e_currie>`__
keynote, it was awesome talk. The way how I think about resource efficiency was
changed after I heard this keynote.  She went into details around
container/server metadata, `lavel-schema.org <http://lavel-schema.org>`__ and
`microbadger.com <http://microbadger.com/>`__ was introduced by her to all of
us.

`Packer <https://www.packer.io/>`__ was mentioned in almost all the talks. OS
Hardening using packer was presented by Xebia, they introduced a lot of security
related tools, as for example `ansible-lockdown
<https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lockdown>`__. Faster and reliable deploys
was explained by `Vik Bhatti <https://twitter.com/otaku_coder>`__ from Beamly,
for me, it was one of the best talks in the conference, I must insight the
following:

- `Smolder test framework <http://sky-shiny.github.io/smolder/>`__: Looks great and maybe I'll do something similar for sip.
- They introduced consul distributed locks, I've never realized of this problem before.
- Consul KV locks and they daemon MarcoPolo => Great way to save config in runtime.
- He introduced `SE4 <https://github.com/beamly/se4>`__:  Simple Spec for Service Status and Health

Day two finished with Nomad Demo by `Kelsey Hightower
<https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower>`__, live coding terraform provider and the
final keynote about security from `nuna.com <https://www.nuna.com/>__`.

I need to say big thanks to all the people that I spoke with and thanks to `Jana
<https://twitter.com/janaboruta>`__, Hashicorp and Xevia for organized this
awesome conference.

Finally, there are few things that I think should be improved so I will write
them down here just in case it could be helpful:

- In my opinion, the talks finished too early in both days. I missed 1 or 2 more talks to finish around 17:30 or 18:00.
- I missed *Best-practices* talks around products, I mean, I would love to hear tips around Consul or Packer by the head of the projects. For example Diptanu talk was great around Nomad.

This was my summary about Hashiconf EU2016. Thanks for reading!
