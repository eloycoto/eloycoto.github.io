As every year, the first week of February, Fosdem took place. The conference was
online for the first time, and I think that we all missed the rain and the snow.

I really enjoyed the conference; it was not the same; also, it was hard to get
time over the weekend to see the talks. Online conferences should rethink a bit
the schedules, but overall I'm more than happy with the result!

As usual, I went to multiple talks. This year, the talk that I most enjoyed was
the one given by `Nuritzi Sanchez <https://twitter.com/1nuritzi>`_, she showed a
different way to think about communication and how to build trust with other
cultures, from now on, I'm going to share with many people `[slides]

Regarding other topics, quite impressed by the `Ernax project
<https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/tee_enarx/>`_ and `ARM Veracruz
<https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/tee_veracruz/>`_, this technology will
be crucial in the next couple of years, and I think this will change how Edge
Computing will behave.

Regarding containers, I highly recommend the talk by my former colleague `Daniel
Borkmann <https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/containers_ebpf_kernel/>`_,
impressive work made by Cilium team. `Viktor Farcic
<https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/speaker/viktor_farcic/>`_ made an excellent
presentation about Argo CD, also recommend his Youtube channel. Another famous
Youtuber, `David McKay
<https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/speaker/david_mckay/>`_, made two talks, I
enjoyed Cluster API one, and the Telegraph one is worth to listen.

`Peter Zaitsev <https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/speaker/peter_zaitsev/>`_ made
many talks, this one about performance testing has very good tips, I'll keep in
my bookmarks for the future, a lot of good things there.

`Brad Fitzpatrick <https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/speaker/brad_fitzpatrick/>`_
background is unachievable, and he shared how Tailscale is using Golang. I loved
Tailscale, and maybe I'm biased, but I found very interesting the problems
regarding Golang net.IP types.

Finally, this was my Fosdem, and I'm so thankful to all organisers to keep the
level so high! Thanks for always giving a weekend of joy!
