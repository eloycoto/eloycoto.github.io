My manager confirmed my promotion to Principal software engineer a few days
ago. Getting in there made me happy; in fact, I enjoyed more the process. I
would share some thoughts with you.

The process is a bit long. To get in there, my manager and I need to write a
document on why you should be promoted, with links and references. And for me,
this is one of the best things where I saw how many things I did correctly from
the beginning of my career; let me share a few:

Brag Document
--------------

I remember reading about companies doing Performance Reviews; at that time, I
only worked for small companies where P&D was not enforced or planned. Getting
a way to know where I was doing good, taking care of the yearly goals, and
setting some direction was game changer for me.

When I wrote the promotion document, I only reviewed the brag documents I had
and got links to things I did correctly, empowering the company, team or
bussiness. It was an easy process because of my brag documents; when I spoke
with colleagues who did not have the document, it was difficult for them if
their manager did not help.

Journal, Journal, Journal
--------------------------

I still remember my early days one of my mentors (`Antón Román
<https://twitter.com/AntonRoman>`_) told me to open a Google doc where I should
save all my tips regarding Linux, small things, and notes. Also, he taught me
how to use Delicious(A bookmark service) and keep all this information sorted
for future use.

Nowadays, I still journal all the conversations, meeting notes, complains to my
manager, so at the end of the year, I can see that I complained to my manager N
times, and how many proposals I made. This has been a powerful thing for me
because It helps me to identify some patterns over time.

Nowadays, I'm using org-mode for the notes, which may be hard to use initially,
but the tags and the to-do list are handy for my use cases.

Growing the mindset
-------------------

I still remember my first week of work, I did not attend any University, and
Antón told me a phrase that It is part of my since then:

::

    An engineer is someone who thinks up.

Since that day, I have taken a self-learnt process. Every day, I normally spend
around 15 minutes learning something new, which has been one of the best things
I have done. When I'm with someone that it's junior, I told them something:
*that it's not taught in the school* is not valid as an engineer, and you'll
need to find the way alone or with help.

Sharing is caring
------------------

There is a book in Spain that it's pretty good (`Aprendiendo a aprender
<https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55683157-aprendiendo-a-aprender>`_) which
teaches you how to learn to learn. Sharing things with a junior engineer,
coworker, or manager is the best way to unlock stuff for companies, and it
helps you to settle the knowledge in your brain. Also, give you superpowers
with your colleagues because you always care about things, and this is why I
mastered being the green CI guy or the refactor man time over time.

Getting feedback&help
----------------------

I live in a place where thinking big is nothing ordinary. When I said to my
parents that I would like to work on Open Source they were scared, and the same
with other many things. To reach where you want to go, you need to realise many
things. You can battle some of them, but at some point, you need to know if
you're doing it correctly and validate it. Over the years, I was lucky to meet
a lot of good engineers out there, and from time to time, I asked them things
to improve my work. For example, I asked too many times to VP level management
people, how I could create more exposure to reach higher or understand the
business process of a change/new product.


To finalise, in April 2009, I started my internship at Quobis. That first day I
cried (a lot), I was scared, and I had zero clue about things. I still remember
that on the first day, Ángel advised me to read the `Asterisk book
<https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/asterisk-the-definitive/9781492031598/>`_;
my English was even crapier than now, and those days I could not even imagine
writing this blog post - I'm currently working at the same company as some
writers of that book-. I'm so thankful for the things I achieved, the people I
learnt from, and all the things I made over this time. To all of you who helped
me with something, many thanks. I really appreciate it!
