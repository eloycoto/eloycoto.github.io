`VigoJug <https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/VigoJUG/>`_ meetup is one of the best
meetups that we have in the town, my close friend `Anton
<https://twitter.com/antonmry>`_ always help me with my Groovy skills and he
helped me to get some Jenkins pipelines to the next level!

Due the job that I made in the last years, I know a lot of Jenkins and he asked
me to give a talk and explain the declarative pipelines, shared libraries and
job-dsl.

The meetup was awesome, we have a full house and `Optare Solutions
<http://optaresolutions.com/>`_ sponsored the beers. Here you have the slides,
sadly this time the meetup was not recorded.
