Embedded Rust is something that it's taken off over the last months. In
February, we will start a Monthly Kata where all of us work on different
projects while learning Embedded rust. 

For these sessions, there is no need to have prior knowledge, and the agenda
for the katas will be like this:

- 9:30  - 10:00 -> Breakfast
- 10:00 - 12:00 -> Pair programming with all of us. 
- 12:00 - 13:30 -> Introduction/Presentation to any specific topic (Testing, CI,
  debugging, etc..)
- 13:30 - 14:00 -> Recap and vote for the presentation on the next topic. 

We'll have an introduction and dev environment setup on the first kata. Over
the next katas, I'll be the presenter for the following topics, so with a month
in advantage; I can prepare the doc/examples, etc. In each Kata, a new topic
will be raised to discuss. The pair programming sessions are to have enough
time to share/ask/do things with others.

My main goal is that a few have a small project to build. I prefer STM32(ARM)
or ESP32 (RISC-V) based projects, so the support is good enough. Regarding
peripherals, we have some in the hackspace, but I highly recommend buying all
in advance, so it can be easy to do.

All the seasons will be on the third Saturday of the month, and I expect some
people to do more pair-programming seasons in the hackspace.
