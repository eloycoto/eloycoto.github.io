A year ago, I was leaving the oncologist's office; everything was dark! I had
no idea if I could move again.

A year later, I can walk without a stick and have a "normal" life! I was lucky
in many ways, but effort is not negotiable. I worked hard and am still working
hard to get better.

Lifting weights is my new life. I shouldn't be capable of doing this, but I
love being the exception and providing good conversations for doctors while
they have their coffee. I'm happy that they can't believe it.

I'm waiting for the second round. It will surely be challenging, but effort is
not negotiable and I'll do my best!

    Nature is peaceful,
    Lost his fear;
    She is sweet and docile
    And rebuilds his heart;
    If thunder roars
    And in his deep voice
    There trouble the world,
    Here we are no longer afraid.
    -- Verne, Storm and Calm
