About Eloy Coto
================

Eloy is a Software Engineer at stealth mode startup, a San Francisco based
company focused on network security. Over the last year I also contributed to
`Cilium <https://cilium.io/>`_, a Kubernetes CNI focussed on performance and
security, my primary role in the project is to make sure that Cilium tests are
extensive and reliable; over this year I implemented a new `end to end
test <https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/1733>`_ framework that allows Cilium
team to test all features in all supported Kubernetes versions.

Before I also work remotely, for a London based startup, `Foehn
<http://foehn.co.uk/>`_ is a company that provides a `cloud Virtual PBX
<https://www.foehn.co.uk/cloud-phone-system/>`_ system to customers. I was the
principal software engineer. I implemented a new CI/CD workflow based on cloud
tools (Packer, Terraform, Cloud-init, Consul) on top of VMware cluster, and also
did a lot of work related with real-time billing and 3-party integrations.

In my early twenties, I was working for one of the most successful startups in
the Galician Ecosystem, `Quobis Networks <https://www.quobis.com/>`_ where I was
developer and head of support.  Furthermore, in
`IPGlobal <https://www.ipglobal.es/>`_ I was software engineer in a well-awarded
`Click to Call <www.webphone.net>`_ service.

I also contributed to multiple open-source projects, in 2014 I did a statsd
module for Kamailio SIP proxy; also I made some contributions to others
projects, like Terraform, Packer, Govmomi, Firefox Servo, Grafana and many more.

Community activity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**VigoLabs meetup group**: was a meetup group focussed on electronics and marine
technologies. Some local companies struggled to get this kind of engineers, so I
started a group to share knowledge, doing networking and make students
interested in local companies. The average number of attendees were near 50
people, and a lot of local companies support this meetup.

**A Industriosa**: due to the traction that Vigolabs meetup group, with a group
of people and the support of six companies we started a new electronics
laboratory where students can learn from seniors, and seniors have space and
tools for side projects. My primary role here was to get sponsors, enhance
members and do some workshops.

**Rally Organization**: When I was in my early 20, I was a member of multiple
teams, and we organised rallies near our town, valid for the regional
championship and Spanish championship. With more than 300 people involved and a
budget over 50K, it was one of my best source of knowledge of diverse team
building. Also, to improve the sport that I love, when I was 16 years old
(2004), I was running one of the trending rally webpages in Spain (sirally.com)
with more than 2000 visits per day.
